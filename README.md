# Clima_App
  Clima is a modern weather app. In this app I learned Dart Futures, Async and Await, Dart Exception Handling and Null Aware Operators, Networking in flutter with the HTTP Package, JSON parsing and Dynamic types, passing data to a State object, passing data backward through Navigation Stack and getting weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
